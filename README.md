Markdown Prawn
==============

Proof of concept for processing Markdown and turning it
into a properly formatted PDF document.

It's very inefficient and isn't a complete implementation
based looseley on the original BlueCloth parser.

It's still a work in progress, and isn't tested or pretty;
but ideas and contributions are welcome.

Usage:
------

       $ ruby markdown_prawn.rb ./test.md 

Requirements:
-------------

  * Prawn
